### **About Me**
#### Hi, my name is Linda, and I'm an MEng student studying Biological Engineering. I also studied at Cornell for undergrad, and I graduated with a BS in Biological Engineering in December 2021. I am interested in synthetic biology and robotics, and I am currently doing my MEng research project on recombineering (recombination-mediated genetic engineering) in the Barstow Lab. I am a part of the Cornell Big Red Pep Band, where I play the flute and trumpet. I am also a chimesmaster, and I like to play ice hockey in my free time.
